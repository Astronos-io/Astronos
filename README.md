# Astronos

Astronos is a digital currency that bridges the worlds between crypto and FIAT money by paying its holders rewards in Binance USD.

Cryptocurrency investors who want to protect their money while also growing it face one main problem which is choosing a coin to invest in that will make the most profit.

Astronos aims to solve this issue by rewarding holders in USD stablecoins to give a real time hedge against future market volatility.


Stable Rewards?

USD Stablecoin rewards solve a host of problems.

First, it helps returns the investors initial investment in a timely manner without selling any assets. The reward amount is based upon the trading volume of the asset.

Second, it encourages investors to hold their tokens for longer periods of time in an effort to garnish higher payouts which are based upon percentages of the total tokens held by the shareholder.

Automatic Liquidity

Automatic Liquidity is a key ingredient to the success of Astronos. This function that acts as a two-fold beneficial implementation for holders.

Initially, the contract taxes trades and transactions from sellers and buyers alike then adds them to the liquidity pool to enforce a solid price floor.

Additionally, the penalty acts as an arbitrage that secures the volume of Binance USD as a reward for the current shareholders.


Strategic Burning

From time to time the Astronos Strategic Growth wallet will buy, sell and burn tokens to improve liquidity flow and ultimately reduce the overall supply. Burns will be based on roadmap milestones and be announced in advance.

To accomplish this, the team will be actively involved in token buybacks and manually burning them once we reach our space race goals. This economic mechanism helps Astronos maintain strong liquidity and price floor.


Mission Control

Mission Control is the foundation of Astronos and its expedition. Mission control researches, funds, develops, and maintains the functionality for the Astronos Token.

Mission Control will be responsible for managing the community and roadmap completion.

Without Mission Control, Astronos would fail.
