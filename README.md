The people's choice
Astronos is the next generation decentralized exchange on Binance Smart Chain, with the highest trading volumes in the market.
Low fees
Why pay more? Astronos runs on Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain with much lower transaction costs than Ethereum or Bitcoin. 
Trading fees are lower than other top decentralized exchanges too, so that's a double win for you!
Decentralized
Trade directly from your wallet app. 
Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, Astronos doesn‚Äôt hold your funds when you trade: you have 100% ownership of your own crypto. 
üí∏ Earn
Earn ASTRO and other tokens for free with super high interest rates.
Earn tokens with Pools
Stake ASTRO, earn free tokens. It‚Äôs really that easy. 
ASTRO holders right now are earning tens of millions of USD worth of free tokens each week from major projects. New projects join the party every day, so you can earn more, for even longer.
Earn ASTRO with Yield Farms
Stake LP tokens, earn ASTRO. You take on a little more exposure to market fluctuations than with the Pools, but can earn higher APR to offset the risk.
Earn Trading Fees
No farm? No problem. Even if your trading pair isn‚Äôt supported on the Farms page, you can still earn trading fees when you stake your tokens in Liquidity Pools (LPs).
